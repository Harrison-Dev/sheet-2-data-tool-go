# Excel Schema Generator - Refactoring Requirements

## Executive Summary

The Excel Schema Generator project requires comprehensive refactoring to transform it from a functional but disorganized codebase into a professional, maintainable Go application. The project currently processes Excel files to generate YAML schemas and JSON data for Unity's master memory project, featuring both CLI and GUI interfaces.

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **Unity Developers**: Game developers using the tool to convert Excel data for Unity projects
- **Data Engineers**: Users who need to process Excel files into structured JSON format
- **CI/CD Systems**: Automated systems that consume the CLI interface for data processing

### Secondary Users
- **Project Maintainers**: Developers responsible for maintaining and extending the codebase
- **Contributors**: Open source contributors who may enhance the project
- **System Administrators**: Users deploying the tool in production environments

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Strengths
- Functional CLI with three main commands: `generate`, `update`, `data`
- Working GUI interface using Fyne framework
- Cross-platform build support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Structured logging implementation
- Basic test coverage
- Unity master memory project compatibility

### Current Issues Identified

#### 1. Code Organization Problems
- Flat project structure with core logic mixed in root directory
- Poor separation of concerns between CLI, GUI, and business logic
- Inconsistent naming conventions across files
- Mixed responsibilities in single files (e.g., main.go handles both CLI parsing and business logic)

#### 2. Documentation Issues
- README.md lacks professional structure and comprehensive information
- Missing API documentation
- No architectural documentation
- Insufficient user guides for complex workflows
- Outdated or missing contribution guidelines

#### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Problems
- Limited platform coverage in automated builds
- Missing automated testing in CI pipeline
- No code quality checks (linting, security scanning)
- Insufficient release automation
- Missing dependency vulnerability scanning

#### 4. GUI/UX Issues
- Basic, utilitarian interface design
- Poor error handling and user feedback
- Limited accessibility features
- No progress indicators for long-running operations
- Inconsistent styling and layout
